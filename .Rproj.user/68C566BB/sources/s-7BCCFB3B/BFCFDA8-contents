## Original Graph
The following homework assignment is about Jia Youâ€™s online graphic about vaccines which can be found
[here](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/here-s-visual-proof-why-vaccines-do-more-good-harm).


## What question is this graphic trying to answer?
I believe that this graphic is trying to answer the question: Do vaccines work?
I think that the author is trying to show that after a vaccine has been licensed for a number of diseases, the number of reported cases (in the U.S.) decreases.
Hence, matching the title of the graphic that "visual proof of why vaccines do more good than harm".

BMB: yes, although the title is a little weird, since it doesn't actually show anything about (potential) harm caused by vaccines ...

## Create 2 new plots with the same data

Read in and prep the data.
```{r read dat}
vac_dat <- read.csv("vaccine_data_online.csv")
#now re-ordering the data 
vac_dat$disease <- with(vac_dat, reorder(disease, cases, FUN = mean))
vac_dat$disease <- with(vac_dat, reorder(disease, cases, FUN =function(x) -x[1]))
## BMB: first line is overwritten by second?
#make dataframe for vaccination licenceing
#to be used in later graphs
vac_l <- vac_dat[which(vac_dat$vaccine != "FALSE"),]
vac_l <- vac_l[,c(3,4)] ## BMB: try not to index columns by number
vac_l <- vac_l[!duplicated(vac_l$disease),]
```

### Graph 1:

The first graph shows the total number of reported cases for each disease in the U.S.
The black vertical lines show the year that the vaccine was licensed for each disease.
```{r g1}
g1 <- ggplot(vac_dat, aes(x = year, y = cases, color = disease))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
g2_fac <- g1 + facet_wrap(~disease)
g2_fac + geom_vline(data = vac_l, aes(xintercept = year)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Reported Cases in U.S.")
```

BMB: could improve labeling on y-axis (divide by 100,000 ?)

Log Transformed:

The graph below is the same as the previous one but with the number of cases transformed (log base 10).
I found it hard to notice the decrease in the number of reported cases in some of the diseases like Pertussis and Polio because there were less reported cases than Measles.

```{r g1log}
#graph
g1_log <- ggplot(vac_dat, aes(x = year, y = cases, color = disease))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
g2_log_fac <- g1_log + facet_wrap(~disease)
g2_log_fac + geom_vline(data = vac_l, aes(xintercept = year)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Reported Cases in U.S.")
```
BMB: can probably repeat less code ... maybe use a lighter color for vaccine licensing date?

### Discussion:

In all of the above graphs the data is read from right to left (BMB: left to right?) which may be culturally easier to read than the original graph which is read from top to bottom.
I also find it easier to see the decreasing trend when it is presented as a line.
Classically humans are better at deciphering trends when they are on a common axis, which is what my graphs show compared to the original graph by Jia You.
Area is also ranked low on Cleveland's list of how accurately humans can visually process data.
I think this makes it hard to interpret Jia You's graph because you are forced to decipher area instead of position along a common axis.
I have also re-ordered the data by mean number of cases reported.
We have learned that the default (usually alphabetical) order is almost never an intuitive way to present the date.
This re-ordering makes it easier to compare between diseases and see which ones have more reported cases on average.



### Graph 2:
This graph shows the same vaccination data but with an area component. The black vertical lines represent the year that the vaccine was licensed for the disease.
The number of cases has been log transformed.

```{r g2}
g_area <- ggplot(vac_dat, aes(x = year, y = cases)) + 
  geom_area(aes(color = disease, fill = disease), 
            alpha = 0.5, position = position_dodge(0.8))+
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_vline(data = vac_l, aes(xintercept = year)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Reported Cases in U.S.")
  
g_area + facet_wrap(~disease)
```

BMB: I think this helps. (Still a whole lot of white space due to equal y-axis scales ...)

Log Transformed:

Again, the graph below is the same as the previous one but with the number of cases transformed (log base 10).

```{r g2_log}
g_area_log <- ggplot(vac_dat, aes(x = year, y = cases)) + 
  geom_area(aes(color = disease, fill = disease), 
            alpha = 0.5, position = position_dodge(0.8))+
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_vline(data = vac_l, aes(xintercept = year)) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Reported Cases in U.S.")
  
g_area_log + facet_wrap(~disease)
```

BMB: this is pretty, but arguably "bad" because the areas are anchoring the graph to the zero line, which is no longer realistic (i.e. area != proportional to total number of cases).  I would instead consider normalizing cases to a max of 1 (but leaving linear scale)

### Discussion:
This graph utilizes the area component of Jia You's graph, having a physical area of the graph represent the number of cases.
I find it easier to see the trend that the number of cases (in the U.S.) decreases after the vaccination date with the area "coloured in".
It is easy to see that at the beginning of the time series (before vaccination licence) that the number of cases was higher than after the vaccination of each disease was licensed.
It is also helpful to have all the graphs displayed in one picture in an orderly format.
This makes it easy to compare between diseases and identify similar trends across all diseases.



## Fun Graphic:
This homework reminded me of one of my favorite data visualization artists Mona Chalabi. She has a really neat visualization of vaccination data
[here.](https://instagram.com/p/BtTjIYwngqn/)

BMB: nice!  Hard to replicate in R ... (I wonder how she built the plot?)


score: 2 (="OK")
