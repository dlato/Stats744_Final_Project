Graphs are attractive and get the job done. The graphical decisions are well explained, though long.

The textual exposition is very repetitive and not very sharp.

What does it mean for dN or dS to be 1. Do they have units? There is virtually no discussion of what dN or dS might mean _beyond_ their ratio, and I am not sure if they add anything at all to the dataviz story you've told.

"log" in log Expression is an incorrect label. Use log when you are actually showing logs (which should be avoided). If it's really necessary to emphasize you've used a log _scale_ that can be done in a caption or text. 

How was the value of c in cKbp chosen?

The color doesn't hurt much, I guess, but is also not adding much. The dS and dN colors are very hard to distinguish for deuteranomalous people.
